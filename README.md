VSGenero
========

This is a Visual Studio extension for the Genero BDL. It supports Visual Studio 2010 and above.

The goal of this project is to provide an experience similar to the C# (or other .NET) editor in Visual Studio. Of course,
this may be more of a pipe-dream, but it's a work in progress.
